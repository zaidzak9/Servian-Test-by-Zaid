Servian Test by Zaid

I made sure i was able to use most of libraries and best practices.
## Project contains:

#### Kotlin
#### Databinding
#### Room DB to store data and display when no internet connection
#### Dependency Injection with Dagger-HILT
#### Unit/Integration/ UI tests
#### Custom Image Loader 
#### Resource Data wrapper and Events class

## 2 branches 
#### development = has no data binding feature
#### dev-with-databinding = has databinding

The reason for 2 branches is because i had issue with Android Studio and was not able to start with databinding , 
nevertheless i was able to solve it and do a version of the App with databinding as well.
